Buying these cabinets might be a challenge because:\n\n* They are **not cheap**\n* They are **bulky** and shipping internationally is often not an option\n* They are **fragile**, so again, shipping is not ideal way to get them\n\n# Some thoughts\n\n## Don\'t mix parts\n![](/assets/img/uploaded/1484581790_cp.png)\n\nOne thing you don\'t want to do is to take 5 unique part types, group them as \'clips\'. You will forget which parts are \'clips\' and which are \'handles\', I guarantee it. Just sort them separately, or don\'t sort them at all.\n\n## Don\'t sort by color\nSort and store your parts by type first. After you\'ve achieved this and you still don\'t mind buying more cabinets start sorting by color.\n\n## Keep an \'unsorted\' bag\nYou won\'t be able to sort everything. There are just too many special parts that you own just 1 piece of. Sort these by size and keep them in a box or a [lego bag](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/45CM-Portable-Kids-Play-Mat-and-Toy-Storage-Bag-Lego-Toys-Organizer-Bin-Box-Blue-Pink/32715379071.html?spm=2114.40010308.4.8.jv4Ocw).\n\n# Which cabinets to buy?\n\nA lot of people from the US are buying [Akro-mills](https://www.amazon.com/Akro-Mils-10164-Plastic-Storage-Hardware/dp/B000LDH3JC) cabinets. These are however not available in Europe.\n\nSo far, I like the cabinets from artplast the most: http://artplast.it/?intl=en&sid=1&lid=18\n\n![](http://artplast.it///images/prodotti/601__209-7a8ad824a732d5ae583841308543b48a/440_440/601_91c75a147a07fe4ae3b7deaf32d17be6.jpg)\n\nThey have a bunch of sizes available, but I like them the most because they are **stackable**. This means you can connect the cabinets to form a wall. This makes it much easier to mount them on wall since you have to drill way less holes and you don\'t see the borders of each cabinet.\n\n## Your feedback\nHave any suggestion which cabinets to buy?
