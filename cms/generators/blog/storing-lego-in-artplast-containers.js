	doc: 'Choosing a storage solution for your LEGO collection can be tiresome. I am a fan of ArtPlast containers. There are several reasons why I like them:\n\n## The quality is great\nThe cabinets slide in and out smoothly and stop once the drawer is fully opened. So far none of the drawers cracked. The plastic is clear and see-through. The drawer has a nice label window and a handle to open it comfortably.\n\n## Cabinets are connectable\nHey, just like LEGO! Each cabinet has sides with rails that allows to connect the cabinets like a puzzle. This is a great feature because you can essentially build a wall of the cabinets and easily mount it with just a few drill holes. You can\'t really see where the cabinets are connected, so you\'ll have just an uniform wall of drawers. The downside is that the connecting can be frustrating as the railing is tight.\n\n## Lots of sizes\nIn the end, LEGO bricks are of different sizes and you\'ll have different quantities, so it\'s awesome that you can choose from lots of sizes. See below for the comparison. For my collection, the most popular is the [601](http://artplast.it/?sid=1&pid=209), which gives you nearly 200 drawers for just 4 cabinets.\n\n## Overview of the cabinets\n\n![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/legolabels/direct_uploads/1485350476_artplast_low.jpg)\n\n[Download the above overview in pdf](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/legolabels/direct_uploads/1485350605_artplast_lego.pdf)\n\nDo you have any suggestions?
